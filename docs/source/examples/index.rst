Transformers4Rec Example Notebooks
==================================

We have created a collection of example Jupyter notebooks using different datasets to demonstrate how to use Transformers4Rec with PyTorch and TensorFlow APIs. Each example notebook provides incremental information about Transformers4Rec features and modules.

Here you can find notebooks with examples on how to use the Transformers4Rec API to define models, train, evaluate and export models for deployment with Triton.
You can find instructions to run the notebooks `here <https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/Transformers4Rec/examples>`_.
