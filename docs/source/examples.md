1 - Getting started with Session-based recommendation (links with details in the docs) 
- Preproc notebook - Synthetic data and NVT preproc
- Separate notebooks for PyT and TF
- TabularSequenceFeature Transformers
- Add a comment saying that RNNs are also supported
- Stop at the eval results
Link to docs that tells about logging (W&B, Tensorboard)

2 - End-2-end session-based recommendation - From preproc to deployment (from our RecSys demo/tutorial notebook)
