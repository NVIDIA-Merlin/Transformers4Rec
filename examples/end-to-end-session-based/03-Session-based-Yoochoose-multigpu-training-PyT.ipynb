    "- <b>Model Parallel</b>: If the model is too large to fit on a single GPU, the parameters are distributed over multiple GPUs. This is usually the case for the RecSys domain since the embedding tables can be exceptionally large and memory intensive.\n",
    "- <b>Data Parallel</b>: Every GPU has a copy of all model parameters and runs the forward/backward pass for its batch. Data parallel is useful when you want to speed-up the training/evaluation of data leveraging multiple GPUs in parallel (as typically data won't fit into GPU memory, that is why models are trained on batches).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we demonstrate how to scale a training pipeline to multi-GPU, single node. The goal is to maximize throughput and reduce training time. In that way, models can be trained more frequently and researches can run more experiments in a shorter time duration. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to training with a larger batch-size. As we are using more GPUs, we have more computational resources and can achieve higher throughput. In data parallel training, it is often required that all model parameters fit into a single GPU. Every worker (each GPU) has a copy of the model parameters and runs the forward pass on their local batch. The workers synchronize the gradients with each other, which can introduce an overhead.\n",

    "Please note these <b>important points</b> that are relevant to multi-gpu training:\n",
    "- <b>specifying multiple GPUs</b>: PyTorch distributed launch environment will recognize that we have two GPUs, since the `--nproc_per_node` arg of `torch.distributed.launch` takes care of assigning one GPU per process and performs the training loop on multiple GPUs (2 in this case) using different batches of the data in a data-parallel fashion.\n",
    "- <b>data repartitioning</b>: when training on multiple GPUs, data must be re-partitioned into >1 partitions where the number of partitions must be at least equal to the number of GPUs. The torch utility library in Transformers4Rec does this automatically and outputs a UserWarning message. If you would like to avoid this warning message, you may choose to manually re-partition your data files before you launch the training loop or function. See [this document](https://nvidia-merlin.github.io/Transformers4Rec/main/multi_gpu_train.html#distributeddataparallel) for further information on how to do manual re-partitioning.\n",
    "- <b>training and evaluation batch sizes</b>: in the default DistributedDataParallel mode we will be running, keeping the batch size unchanged means each worker will receive the same-size batch despite the fact that you are now using multiple GPUs. If you would like to keep the total batch size constant, you may want to divide the training and evaluation batch sizes by the number of GPUs you are running on, which is expected to reduce time it takes train and evaluate on each batch.\n",
