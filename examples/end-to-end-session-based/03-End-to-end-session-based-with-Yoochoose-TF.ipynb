    "In recent years, several deep learning-based algorithms have been proposed for recommendation systems while its adoption in industry deployments have been steeply growing. In particular, NLP inspired approaches have been successfully adapted for sequential and session-based recommendation problems, which are important for many domains like e-commerce, news and streaming media. Session-Based Recommender Systems (SBRS) have been proposed to model the sequence of interactions within the current user session, where a session is a short sequence of user interactions typically bounded by user inactivity. They have recently gained popularity due to their ability to capture short-term or contextual user preferences towards items. \n",
    "\n",
    "The field of NLP has evolved significantly within the last decade, particularly due to the increased usage of deep learning. As a result, state of the art NLP approaches have inspired RecSys practitioners and researchers to adapt those architectures, especially for sequential and session-based recommendation problems. Here, we leverage one of the state-of-the-art Transformer-based architecture, [XLNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237) with `Causal Language Modeling (CLM)` training technique. Causal LM is the task of predicting the token following a sequence of tokens, where the model only attends to the left context, i.e. models the probability of a token given the previous tokens in a sentence (Lample and Conneau, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this end-to-end-session-based recommnender model example, we use `Transformers4Rec` library, which leverages the popular [HuggingFace’s Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) NLP library and make it possible to experiment with cutting-edge implementation of such architectures for sequential and session-based recommendation problems. For detailed explanations of the building blocks of Transformers4Rec meta-architecture visit [getting-started-session-based](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/Transformers4Rec/tree/main/examples/getting-started-session-based) and [tutorial](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/Transformers4Rec/tree/main/examples/tutorial) example notebooks."

In addition, the module provides different aggregation methods (e.g. 'concat', 'elementwise-sum') to merge input features and generate the sequence of interactions embeddings. The module also supports language modeling tasks to prepare masked labels for training and evaluation (e.g: 'clm' for causal language modeling).\n",
