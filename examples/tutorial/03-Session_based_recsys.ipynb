XLNet [9] was proposed as a generalized autoregressive (AR) pretraining method that uses a permutation language modeling (PLM) objective to combine the advantages of AR and auoencoding (AE) methods. Here, we use XLNet as the Transformer block in our meta-architecture and train the model with `Masked Language Model (MLM)` masking method. XLNet's main contribution is a modified language model training objective which learns conditional distributions for all permutations of tokens in a sequence[8]. \n",

    "MLM  pre-training objective was introduced in `BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding` paper [7]. The Figure 5 illustrates the masking methods, causal language modeling (LM) and masked LM, that we use in RNN and XLNet-MLM, respectively. Causal LM is the task of predicting the token following a sequence of tokens, where the model only attends to the left context, i.e. models the probability of a token given the previous tokens in a sentence [6]. The MLM randomly masks some of the tokens from the input sequence, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. The Transformer layer is allowed to use positions on the right (future information) during training. During inference, all past items are visible for the Transformer layer, which tries to predict the next item. In our experiments [7] we obtained very promising accuracy results with XLNET-MLM which allows the use of future information during training, and performs a type of data augmentation, by masking different positions of the sequences in each training epoch. Therefore, in this tutorial we use masked LM as masking method."
