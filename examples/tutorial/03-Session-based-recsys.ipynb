For the output layer we provide the `Tying Embeddings` technique (`weight_tying`). It was proposed originally by the NLP community to tie the weights of the input (item id) embedding matrix with the output projection layer, showed to be a very effective technique in extensive experimentation for competitions and empirical analysis (for more details see our [paper](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/publications/blob/main/2021_acm_recsys_transformers4rec/recsys21_transformers4rec_paper.pdf) and its online [appendix](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/publications/blob/main/2021_acm_recsys_transformers4rec/Appendices/Appendix_A-Techniques_used_in_Transformers4Rec_Meta-Architecture.md)). In practice, such technique helps the network to learn faster item embeddings even for rare items, reduces the number of parameters for large item cardinalities and enables Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN) search on inference, as the predictions can be obtained by a dot product between the model output and the item embeddings."

Hence, the Transformer overperforms RNNs with their three mechanisms: \n",

On the other hand, the Transformer is a more powerful architecture because the self-attention mechanism is capable of representing dependencies within the sequence of tokens, favors parallel processing and handle longer sequences.\n",

    "Here, we use XLNet [10] as the Transformer block in our architecture. It was originally proposed to be trained with the *Permutation Language Modeling (PLM)*  technique, that combines the advantages of autoregressive (Causal LM) and autoencoding (Masked LM). Although, we found out in our [paper](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/publications/blob/main/2021_acm_recsys_transformers4rec/recsys21_transformers4rec_paper.pdf) [8] that the *Masked Language Model (MLM)* approach worked better than PLM for the small sequences in session-based recommendation, thus we use MLM for this example. MLM was introduced in *BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding* paper [8]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 5 illustrates the causal language modeling (LM) and masked LM. In this example, we use in causal LM for RNN masked LM for XLNet. Causal LM is the task of predicting the token following a sequence of tokens, where the model only attends to the left context, i.e. models the probability of a token given the previous tokens in a sentence [7]. On the other hand, the MLM randomly masks some of the tokens from the input sequence, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its bi-directional context. When we train with MLM, the Transformer layer is also allowed to use positions on the right (future information) during training. During inference, all past items are visible for the Transformer layer, which tries to predict the next item. It performs a type of data augmentation, by masking different positions of the sequences in each training epoch."
