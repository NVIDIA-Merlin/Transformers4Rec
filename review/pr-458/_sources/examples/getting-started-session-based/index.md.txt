# Getting Started: Session-based Recommendation with Synthetic Data

This example notebook focuses on the following basic concepts of Transformers4Rec:

* Generating synthetic data of user interactions.
* Preprocessing sequential data with NVTabular on GPU.
* Using the NVTabular dataloader with Pytorch.
* Training a session-based recommendation model with a Transformer architecture (XLNET).

Refer to the following notebooks:

* [ETL with NVTabular](01-ETL-with-NVTabular.ipynb)
* Session based XLNET:  [TensorFlow](03-session-based-XLNet-with-TF.ipynb) | [PyTorch](02-session-based-XLNet-with-PyT.ipynb)
